# CovidTracker-C
C program called covidtracker.c that takes a file as an input (./covidtracker statsfile.txt). 
The file is a series of patients and who they infected, not including Patient Zero, the Blue Devil.
The program outputs a tree (data structure hint!), depth first, starting at the BlueDevil at the root.
